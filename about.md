I'm a product manager by day, creator by night. This site is my digital playground, where I document my creative journey to write more, learn UI/UX and practice sketching.

## About Me

I'm a Generalist/[Wildcard](https://merki.ca/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-person). In a nutshell: I enjoy doing lots of things. Professionally, I found my footing as a Product Manager, but I'm proud of the many odd, ambiguous titles I've held throughout my career that didn't describe what I _actually_ did (Special Projects Manager, Growth Lead or Senior Associate).

Previously, I was the 1st PM at [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com/), Canada's largest bitcoin neobank, and I was also a Founder in Residence as part of Entrepreneur First's 2022 accelerator cohort.

I love product psychology and executing on ideas to make apps grow _fast_. More importantly, I'm fascinated at the idea of people developing their [craft](https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/) - especially in the context of designing products people use everyday.

At heart, I'm a designer and a creative, but over the years I've lost touch with that side of me. That's why I started this site. My goal is to use it as a place to document my journey to create more; whether through writing, design, sketching or whatever form it takes.

I hope you'll stick around for the ride!
