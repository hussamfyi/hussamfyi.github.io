## About me

I'm Hussam, a product manager based in Toronto.

I'm a [third culture kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid): I was born to Syrian parents, raised in Qatar, and I immigrated to Canada in 2010.

I love design. When I was in my teens I wanted to become an industrial designer but I chose to pursue an engineering degree instead. After graduating, I yearned to become a designer, but I never took the plunge. So I built this site. I want to use it as a digital playground of sorts; a safe, open space to document my creative journey to learn design, write more, and share the fruits of my creative pursuits.

I'd describe myself as a Generalist/[Wildcard](https://merki.ca/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-person). Professionally, I like wearing multiple hats, but I sort of found my footing as a product manager, even though I'm proud of the many weird, confusing titles I've had throughout my career that didn't describe what I _actually_ did at the time e.g. Special Projects Manager, Growth Lead or Senior Associate.

I love watching combat sports, and I also train Muay Thai 3-4x per week. Practicing martial arts has been an incredible value-add to my life. [Muay Thai is pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ4vgq47Cco&t=427s), and it's constantly forcing me to examine and confront my relationship to hardship, discomfort and the pursuit of mastery.

Music is an essential aspect of my life. I've been playing the drums since I was 13, and absolutely love drumming along to progressive metal music; especially bands like Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree and Mastodon. Still, if it's music, I can appreciate it. I listen to all kinds of genres; hip-hop, psychedelic rock, reggae. You name it.
