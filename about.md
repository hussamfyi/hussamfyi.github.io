## About me

I'm Hussam, and I'm based in Toronto. I grew up in Qatar to Syrian parents, and I immigrated to Canada in 2010. I'm bilingual in both English and Arabic, and I'm proud of my heritage.

At heart, I'm a designer and a creative, but over the years I've lost touch with that side of me. That's one of the main reasons I built this website. My goal is to use it as a digital playground of sorts; a safe, open space to document my creative journey, and share my work, whether through writing, learning design or 

I'd describe myself as a Generalist/[Wildcard](https://merki.ca/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-person). Professionally, I like wearing multiple hats, but I sort of found my footing as a product manager, even though I'm proud of the many weird, confusing titles I've had throughout my career that didn't describe what I _actually_ did at the time e.g. Special Projects Manager, Growth Lead or Senior Associate.

I love watching combat sports, and I also train Muay Thai 3-4x per week. Practicing martial arts has been an incredible value-add to my life. [Muay Thai is pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ4vgq47Cco&t=427s), and it's constantly forcing me to examine and confront my relationship to hardship, discomfort and the pursuit of mastery.

Music is an essential aspect of my life. I've been playing the drums since I was 13, and absolutely love drumming along to progressive metal music; especially bands like Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree and Mastodon. Still, if it's music, I can appreciate it. I listen to all kinds of genres; hip-hop, psychedelic rock, reggae. You name it.
