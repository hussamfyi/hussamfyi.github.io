I'm a former Product Manager exploring the [pathless path](https://think-boundless.com/the-pathless-path/). Frankly, I'm not sure where I'm going, but I'm using this site to document my journey and share lessons along the way. Hope you stick around!

## About Me

I'm a Generalist/[Wildcard](https://merki.ca/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-person). In a nutshell: I enjoy doing lots of things. Professionally, I found my footing as a Product Manager, but I'm still proud of the many weird, ambiguous titles I've held throughout my career like Special Projects Manager (WTF), Growth Lead or Sr. Associate. Previously, I worked at [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com/), Canada's largest bitcoin neobank, and I also had a brief stint as a Founder in Residence as part of Entrepreneur First's 2022 Toronto cohort.

I'm fascinated by the idea of developing one's [craft](https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/) - especially when it comes to designing products people use everyday. Truthfully, I'm a designer and a creaitve at heart, but over the years I lost touch with the craft. That's why I started this site. My goal is to use it as a digital playground to document my creative journey to write more, practice UX/UI design and start sketching again.
