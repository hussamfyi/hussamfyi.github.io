  This site is my lifelog and digital playground. I embarked on the pathless path last year when I quit my full-time job as a product manager. I'm not exactly sure where I'm going, but I'm using this space to document my journey and share lessons along the way. Hope you stick around!

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

- [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com)
- [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com)
