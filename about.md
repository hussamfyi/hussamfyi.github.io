## About me

I'm Hussam, a product manager based in Toronto.

I'm a [third culture kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid): I was born to Syrian parents, raised in Qatar, and I immigrated to Canada in 2010.

I love design. When I was in my teens, I wanted to become an industrial designer, but I chose to pursue an engineering degree. After graduating, I still yearned to become a designer, but I never took the plunge. So, I'm doing it now (sort of).

I built this site to be a digital playground to document my product design journey. It's an open space where I can share what I learn on design and practice my writing.

Professionally, I [work](hussam.fyi/work) in product, but I'd also describe myself as a generalist/[wildcard](https://merki.ca/blog/what-is-a-wildcard-person). I like to wear multiple hats, and I'm proud of the many ambiguous titles I've had throughout my career - like 'Special Projects Manager' or 'Growth Lead' - that don't describe what I _actually_ did in those roles.

I train Muay Thai 3-4x per week. It's changed my life. I deeply value martial arts as an outlet to confront [pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ4vgq47Cco&t=427s), manage dangerous situations, and pursue mastery. At some point in the next year, I plan to have an amateur fight. 

Music is an essential aspect of my life. I've been playing the drums since I was 13, and absolutely love drumming along to progressive metal music - especially bands like Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree and Mastodon. I also love listening to hip-hop, psychedelic rock, reggae, soul and jazz.
