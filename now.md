## Creating things on the Internet

I'm spending my time writing and publshing my work on my blog and occasionally Twitter or LinkedIn. I'm also self-learning product design (a lifelong passion). To pay the bills, I consult pre-seed and Series A fintech startups on product growth.

<p class="message">
I'm open to exploring product roles at early-stage fintech or SaaS startups with a killer team and fiery mission. If you're hiring, please reach out!
