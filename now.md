## Building [digital leverage](https://visualizevalue.com/blogs/feed/how-to-build-leverage) by creating things on the Internet

Currently, I am:

* Self-teaching product design (and visual tools like Figma and Framer)
* Writing [here](https://hussam.substack.com/), on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/hussamfyi) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussamfyi) as part of [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/)'s 11th Cohort

I also spend half of my time consulting pre-seed to Series A fintech startups on product growth. It's how I pay the bills.

## Ushering in the Bitcoin Golden Age at [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com)

I was the 1st product/growth hire at Shakepay ($35M Series A) - Canada's largest bitcoin neobank.

Some of my proudest accomplishments:
