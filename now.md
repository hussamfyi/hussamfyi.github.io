## Ushering in the Bitcoin Golden Age at [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com)

I was the 1st product/growth hire at Shakepay ($35M Series A) - Canada's largest bitcoin neobank.

Some of my proudest accomplishments:

* Led Growth team of 4 and drive $840 million in total exchange volume while growing MAUs to 150,000 (400% increase)
* Got 120,000 Canadians to sign up for the [Shakepay Card](https://shakepay.com/card) in 6 months post-launch
* Designed the [Shakepay Card waitlist](https://blog.shakepay.com/introducing-the-shakepay-card/) which got 180,000 waitlisters and 10x'ed payments volume. Plus, we out-trended the Queen of England on Twitter on her own birthday!
* Owned design, development and launch of card features like [ShakeSquads](https://blog.shakepay.com/stack-sats-with-your-friends/) and [Shakepaid](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23shakepaid) which boosted retention by 30%, and grew core card metrics incl. total card transaction volume (28%), average spend per user (512%) and average transaction count (1,000%)
