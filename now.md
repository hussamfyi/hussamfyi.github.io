## Building [digital leverage](https://visualizevalue.com/blogs/feed/how-to-build-leverage) by creating things on the Internet

Half my time is spent consulting pre-seed and Series A fintech startups on product growth. It's how I pay my bills.

When I'm not consulting, I'm:

* Learning the product design craft
* Writing [here](/writing) and at: [Twitter ↗](https://www.twitter.com/hussamfyi) or [LinkedIn ↗](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussamfyi)

<p class="message">
I'm open to product roles at growth-stage fintech or SaaS startups with a killer team and fiery mission. If you're hiring, please reach out!

## Ushering in the Bitcoin Golden Age at [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com)

I was the 1st product/growth hire at Shakepay ($35M Series A) - Canada's largest bitcoin neobank. Below are some things I'm exceptionally proud of:

* Launching the [Shakepay Card](https://shakepay.com/card) which captured 120,000 cardholders in < 6 months
* Designing the [Shakepay Card go-to-market strategy](https://blog.shakepay.com/introducing-the-shakepay-card/) which grew to 180,000 waitlisters and ballooned payments volume by 900% - we also out-trended the Queen of England on Twitter on her own birthday!.
* Owning the design, development and launch of social card features like [ShakeSquads](https://blog.shakepay.com/stack-sats-with-your-friends/) and [Shakepaid](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23shakepaid) which boosted retention by 30% and core card metrics such as total card transaction volume (28%), average spend per user (512%) and average transaction count (1,000%).
* Leading a Growth team of 4 to drive $840 million in total exchange volume and increasing MAUs by 400% to 150,000.
