## Previously

I was the 1st product manager and 9th hire at [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com) - Canada’s largest bitcoin neobank that went on to raise a $35 million Series A. While there, I got the chance to design, build and launch game-changing consumer fintech products like the [Shakepay prepaid Visa card](https://shakepay.com/card), [peer-to-peer payments](https://decrypt.co/44519/bitcoin-app-shakepay-p2p-payments-canada-cashapp) and more.

I was also a Founder in Residence at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.google.com/search?q=entrepreneurfirst&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)'s (EF) Fall 2022 Toronto cohort, where I was handpicked from 10,000+ applicants for their pre-seed accelerator program. Things didn't work out, but I learned a lot about myself in the process.

### Some things I'm proud of:

* Launched the [Shakepay Card](https://shakepay.com/card) and created 120,000 cardholders in 6 months
* Designed the [Shakepay Card waitlist](https://blog.shakepay.com/introducing-the-shakepay-card/) which captured 180,000 waitlisters and grew payments volume by 900% (we also outtrended the Queen of England on Twitter on her own birthday!)
* Participated in EF's rigorous 12-week bootcamp and pitched weekly to a panel of judges at leading VC firms
* Published 50+ essays on product and startups on Twitter and LinkedIn
* Co-led fundraise with CEO at [Lake Finance](http://lake.finance/)/[Buy With Impact](https://buywithimpact.com/) which got us acquihired by RBC Ventures
