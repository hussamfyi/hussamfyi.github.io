<p>I come across at least 1 spicy take on design every day while scrolling through Twitter.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Designers should learn how to code.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>AI is going to replace designers in 5 years.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>You shouldn't name your Figma layers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here's one I came across recently from a seasoned designer (and now full-time creator):</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UX is dead. <br><br>Paul sees that shift too. <br><br>And so many are still in denial. <a href="https://t.co/plI8qMTs1A">pic.twitter.com/plI8qMTs1A</a></p>&mdash; Michal Malewicz (@michalmalewicz) <a href="https://twitter.com/michalmalewicz/status/1689664253559554049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Since I'm trying to learn UI/UX in my spare time, it can be confusing and disheartening to read takes like this. There may be a sprinkle of truth to them, but I've found it helpful to remind myself that people are incentivized to say controversial things on social media because it leads to clicks and eyeballs.</p>

<p>Still, I think it's worth considering how the UI/UX design field will evolve over time, especially with the advent of AI, and exploring what designers can do to adapt to our fast-changing world.</p>

<p>Mind you, I'm not a product designer, so I can't offer a credible perspective on this topic.</p>

<p>Instead, I'll share what other designers think by posting their takes here (from spicy to inspirational) and I'll add a comment to each one if I feel I can add to the conversation.</p>
