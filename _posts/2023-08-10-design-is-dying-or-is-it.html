title: Design is dying. Or is it?

<p>I come across at least 1 spicy take on design every day while scrolling through Twitter.</p>

<p>"Design is dead. AI will replace every one. Design is just pushing pixels and moving rectangles. It's commoditized."</p>

<p>Since I'm trying to learn UI/UX in my spare time, it can be uncomfortable reading takes like this. There may be some truth to these takes, but it's important to recognize content creators are incentivized to say outrageous things on social media because it's good for impressions and engagement.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the idea holds any weight, it's a worthwhile conversation to consider how the UI/UX design field might evolve over time, and what designers can do to adapt to our fast-changing world.</p>

<p>Mind you, I'm not a product designer, so I can't offer any credible advice on this topic.</p>

<p>Instead, I'm collecting all the interesting design takes I find (from spicy to inspiring) and sharing my favourite ones here."
