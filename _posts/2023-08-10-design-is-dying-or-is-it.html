title: Design is dying. Or is it?

<p>I come across at least 1 rehashed spicy take on design every day while scrolling through Twitter.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designers should learn how to code.</li>
  <li>AI is going to replace designers in 5 years.</li>
  <li>You shouldn't name your Figma layers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently I came across yet another "UX is dead" tweet. This time from a seasoned designer (and now full-time creator) called Michal Malewicz.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UX is dead. <br><br>Paul sees that shift too. <br><br>And so many are still in denial. <a href="https://t.co/plI8qMTs1A">pic.twitter.com/plI8qMTs1A</a></p>&mdash; Michal Malewicz (@michalmalewicz) <a href="https://twitter.com/michalmalewicz/status/1689664253559554049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As someone learning UI/UX in my spare time, it can be disheartening to read takes like this. There may be a sprinkle of truth to them, but it's useful to remind yourself that people are incentivized to say controversial things on social media because it leads to clicks and eyeballs.</p>

<p>Still, I think it's worth considering how the UI/UX design field will evolve over time, especially with the advent of AI, and exploring what designers can do to adapt to our fast-changing world.</p>

<p>Mind you, I'm not a product designer, so I can't offer a credible perspective on this topic.</p>

<p>Instead, I'll share what other designers think by posting their takes here (from spicy to inspirational) and I'll add a comment to each one if I feel I can add to the conversation.</p>

<p>Grab some popcorn and enjoy.</p>
