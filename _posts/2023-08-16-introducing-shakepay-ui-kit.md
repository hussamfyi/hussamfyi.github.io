I decided to build a [Shakepay](https://shakepay.com) UI Kit on Figma, which I also published to the Figma Community [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1271968504374598505).

**What's inside:**
- ðŸ‘¾ Vectors and icons
- ðŸ”˜ Buttons (with different states)
- ðŸŒˆ Preset colour and text styles

I made each part of the UI Kit from scratch entirely on Figma. It took me about 20 hours in total.

Since [I used to work at Shakepay](/now), I have some context around what product and design decisions led to the app looking the way it does. As a product manager, I was even responsible for making some of those decisions myself, but recreating the app gave me a deeper appreciation for the thinking that went behind the design for each screen.

For starters, the Home screen makes liberal use of white space. It's the first touchpoint a user has with the product, and the team's done a clever job of displaying only the most critical bits of information there, like total and individual asset balances, non-invasive calls-to-action for adding or sending funds, and the navigation bar which cleanly highlights core functions of the app: View balances, Spend, Exchange, Send money and View settings.

_Small side note: I noticed some screens used different text size and weight variations for headings and paragraphs. This was also true for text and element colours_

The Shakepay Card screen on the other hand was a counterexample to the simplicity of the Home screen. It's cluttered with multiple calls-to-action, features to be explored, counters, progress bars and more.

Part of the reason behind this cluttered view of the Card screen is that Canadian fintechs like Shakepay must comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to the card user experience. These are usually imposed by issuing banks like Peoples Trust, or even payment processors and networks like Visa and Marqeta, which Shakepay partners with to be able to offer their prepaid Visa card program.

I think it would be a fun exercise to redesign the Shakepay Card screen. I'll explore the UIs of other debit card apps for inspiration and come up with my own original version of the Shakepay Card screen.

Stay tuned!
