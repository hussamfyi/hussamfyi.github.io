I decided to build a Shakepay UI Kit on Figma, which I also published to the Figma Community.

It includes:
- Vectors and icons
- Buttons (with different states)
- Preset text and colour styles

All of which were entirely remade by me on Figma. It took me about 20 hours in total to do.

Since I used to work at Shakepay, I have some context around what product and designs led to the app looking the way it does. As a product manager, I was even responsible for making some of those decisions myself, but recreating the app gave me a deeper appreciation for the thinking that went behind the design for each screen.

For starters, the Home screen makes liberal use of white space. It's the first touchpoint a user has with the product, and the team's done a clever job of displaying only the most critical bits of information there like total and individual asset balances, non-invasive calls-to-action for adding or sending funds, and the navigation bar which cleanly highlights the core functions of the app: View balances, Spend, Exchange, Send money and View settings.

(Small side note: I noticed some screens used different text size and weight variations for headings and paragraphs. This was also true for text and element colours)

The Shakepay Card screen on the other hand was a counterexample to the simplicity of the Home screen. It's cluttered with multiple calls-to-action, features to be explored, counters, progress bars and more.

Part of the reason behind the cluttered view of the Card screen is that Canadian fintechs like Shakepay have to comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to the card user experience. These are usually imposed by issuing banks like Peoples Trust, or even payment processors and networks like Visa and Marqeta, which Shakepay partners with to be able to offer their prepaid Visa card program.

I think it would be a fun to exercise to redesign the Shakepay Card screen on my own.

I'll try exploring the UIs of other debit card apps and see if I can source some inspiration to come up with a Shakepay Card 2.0 screen. Maybe I'll document my process here too.

Stay tuned!
