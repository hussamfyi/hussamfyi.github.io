title: Write honestly

I’ve noticed there’s a part of me that views writing as an outlet to seek validation from the world. When that part takes over, I start to sound like a caricature of myself. A version of me who’s got the world figured out. I’ll inflate the truth more. Make polarizing statements (even ones I don’t agree with). Structure essays in the same way.

I stop sounding like Hussam.

Seeking validation is the modus operandi of social media platforms, and I wanted to play that game. So I decided to take a Twitter audience building course January 2022. The course gave me the courage to start publishing my writing but I wasn’t prepared to deal with the performance anxiety that came with writing online. Writing inauthentically became my coping mechanism. And it worked for a while, but something never felt right.

If you’re trying to build an audience, your follower count is your primary indicator of success. It’s more or less a representation of how good you are at capturing, and retaining, people’s attention with your content. The audience building course was focused on juicing pumping those numbers up using every tactic in the book.

The course offered writing frameworks with a formulaic, almost Silicon Valley-like, approach. They shared tactics upon tactics to produce (and ‘validate’) content ideas, write catchy hooks and structure content in a templated fashion to keep readers engaged. The consequence? All 400+ course members wrote content that sounded exactly the same.

The course had missed something important: Sure, perhaps audience building can be solved like a math equation, but writing is an arform, and artistic capability can’t be taught. It must be cultivated by a writer through authentic self-expression. That's where beauty lies.

That's why I’m trying to tell the truth more. To be honest about how I’m really feeling, and most important of all, write like a human being. Interestingly enough, when I do these things, my body starts to shake nervously. To me, that’s a sign I’m doing something right, because it means I’m being vulnerable and real with my writing.

It means that, even for a split second, I gave the reader (you) a glimpse into the real Hussam.

And that's where the magic happens.
