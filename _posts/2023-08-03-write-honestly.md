title: Write honestly
---

I’ve noticed there’s a part of me that views writing as an outlet to seek validation from the world. When this part takes over, I sound like a polished caricature of myself when I write.

I stop sounding like Hussam.

Seeking validation is the modus operandi of social media platforms which drew me to take a [Twitter audience building course](https://ship30for30.com/) on January 2022. It gave me the courage to start publishing my writing, but honestly, I wasn’t prepared to deal with the 'pressure to perform' that comes with writing online.

The course focused on how to get more followers since it's one of many key success indicators in the world of audience building. We were flooded with writing tactics on how to produce (and ‘validate’) content ideas, write catchy hooks and structure content using proven templates to keep readers engaged. It was like Lean Startup applied to writing.

By the end of the course, it felt like we were all writing content that sounded the same. After all, we followed the same recipe.

Perhaps audience building can be solved like a math equation, but writing itself is an arform. You can't teach that. It has to be explored by writers through authentic self-expression. When we apply a recipe to writing well, we take the magic out of it. That's why when I write, I’m trying to tell the truth more, express how I’m really feeling, and most important of all, to [write like I talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html).

When I write from the heart I can feel it - I get nervous and my body starts to shake. To me, that’s a sign I’m on the right track, because it means I’m being vulnerable. That I'm giving the reader (you) a glimpse into who the real Hussam is.

And that's where the magic happens.
