title: Audience building vs. writing
---

Last year, I took a Twitter audience building course called [Ship 30 for 30](https://ship30for30.com/). It's a cohort-based course aimed at getting beginner writers to create 30 pieces of published writing over 30 days.

The course offered a ton of useful writing frameworks to help with generating (and ‘validating’) content ideas, writing catchy hooks and structuring content to keep readers engaged.

As I continued applying these frameworks, I noticed something interesting: my writing lacked personality.

It's like I was trying to write sales letters instead of honestly expressing myself. I felt this 'pressure to perform' whenever I wrote anything.

I think if you're trying to build an audience, writing frameworks are useful. Beyond that, I'm not so sure. Writing is an artform - it's part-science, part-magic. And the magic, you can't _really_ teach.

The medium also matters. I used to only write on Twitter or LinkedIn because I wanted to build an audience so I had to follow that recipe.

This blog is an opportunity for me to challenge that approach to writing. It's my digital home, where I can write about whatever I want.
