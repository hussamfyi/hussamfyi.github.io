Last year, I took a Twitter audience building course called [Ship 30 for 30](https://ship30for30.com/). It's a cohort-based course aimed at getting beginner writers to create 30 pieces of published writing over 30 days.

The course offered a ton of useful writing frameworks to help with generating (and ‘validating’) content ideas, writing catchy hooks and structuring content to keep readers engaged.

As I continued to apply these frameworks, I noticed over time that my writing lacked personality.

My work began to read more like a sales letter than an authentic expression of who I am. I think it's because I felt the 'pressure to perform' whenever I wrote anything.

Over time, I've developed more of a nuanced take on writing. I think if you're trying to build an audience, writing frameworks can work, but writing must be appreciated as an artform - it's part-science, part-magic. And the magic, you can't _really_ teach.

The medium also matters. I stuck to writing _only_ on Twitter or LinkedIn for a long time because I wanted to building an audience - so I kept following the 'audience-building' recipe.

This blog is a chance to challenge that by giving myself a space to write authentically and discover my writing voice.
