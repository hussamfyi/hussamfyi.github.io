Last year, I took a Twitter audience building course called [Ship 30 for 30](https://ship30for30.com/). It's a cohort-based course aimed at getting beginner writers to create 30 pieces of published writing over 30 days.

Ship30for30 was my introduction to digital writing. It gave me the courage to put my work out there, but after the course ended I wasn’t prepared to deal with the 'pressure to perform' that comes with writing online.

The course offered a ton of helpful writing frameworks to help with generating (and ‘validating’) content ideas, writing catchy hooks and structuring content to keep readers engaged.

By applying these frameworks, I noticed over time that my writing lacked my personality.

It read more like a sales offer than an authentic expression of who I am.

After the course, I have more of a nuanced take on writing. I think if you're trying to build an audience, writing frameworks can work. But writing is an artform - part-science, part-magic. And the magic, you can't _really_ teach.

The medium also matters. I stuck to writing _only_ on Twitter or LinkedIn for a long time so I kept writing things that followed the 'audience-building' recipe. That's why I spun up a blog - to give myself permission to write authentically.

I'm still trying to manage the temptation to stick to the recipe, and discover my own authentic writing voice. Like anything, it's a work in progress.
