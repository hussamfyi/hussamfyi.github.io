title: Learning how to learn UI design

<p>I'm trying to learn UI design. So far it's been fun, but also daunting. It's such a complex and multifaceted discipline, and I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.</p>

<p>I thought about doing a bootcamp but I've read mixed reviews about them, and they're pretty expensive. Besides, I've fallen into the trap of paying thousands of dollars for courses, and I never found them particularly useful.</p>

<p>If I'm being honest with myself, there are two main reasons why I'd even consider taking a design course: 1) to escape the uncertainty and feelings of frustration that comes with learning a new skill and 2) because paying for something makes me feel like I'm making progress.</p>

<p>Right now, there's a massive gap between my taste and ability to craft anything. I have plenty of ideas for digital products (who doesn't?) but whenever I try to make them, I fall short.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">‘All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. Your taste is good enough that you can tell what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you... It’s only by going through a volume of work that you’re going to catch up &amp; close that gap.’ —Ira Glass <a href="https://t.co/VxNcKtLvjX">pic.twitter.com/VxNcKtLvjX</a></p>&mdash; Aletheia Délivré (@delivreal) <a href="https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1385236589547331589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I expected learning design to be this fun, linear process - even though I know it's foolish to expect that of anything.</p>

<p>As a teen, I was intrinsically drawn to design, and my learning was self-directed. I'd pick up tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Google Sketchup, mainly by tackling personal projects or occasionally as part of the coursework for my industrial design class.</p>

<p>Looking back now, it was never fun all the time. I'd often struggle for hours trying to get something to look right, or just work! The difference between then vs. now is I didn't run away from that struggle. I knew I was learning.</p>

<p>As I grew older, I fell victim to what I call the "Flywheel of Inaction" when it came to exploring design:</p>

<p>I can't count how many times I've gone through this loop. Frankly, I don't even know if I want to be a full-time product designer, but I just have this gut feeling of wanting to design more. I think it makes sense to follow it and see where it leads.</p>

<p>Anyways, here's something I worked on last week:</p>

<h2 class="post.title">Recreating Arc Browser in Figma </h2>

<img src="/assets/arc-mock.png">

<p>I managed to recreate the entire Arc Browser UI in Figma, by copying and following <a href="https://macnason.com/">Mac Nason's</a> <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1206735913962953604/Arc-Browser---UI-Kit">Arc Browser UI Kit</a> file.</p>

<p>I started a blank design file and recreated each of the components including sections, buttons etc. (except for some icons I found too difficult and time-consuming to remake).</p>

<p>To be honest, this exercise gave me a ton of appreciation for digital product designers. It's not easy to recreate an existing UI in the way Mac did. Now, imagine designing it from scratch!</p>

<p>Copying feels like a great way to learn Figma. All the design decisions that connect components together, or display them to the end user in a certain way have already been made.</p>

<p>It becomes my job to draw connections between components and make sense of them.</p>
