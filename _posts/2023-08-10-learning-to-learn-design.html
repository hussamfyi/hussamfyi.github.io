<p>Trying to learn product design has been fun, but also daunting. It's such a complex and multifaceted discipline that I often feel like I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.</p>

<p>I thought about doing a UX bootcamp but I've read mixed reviews about them, and they're pretty expensive. Besides, I've fallen into the trap before of paying thousands of dollars for courses, and I usually can't remember a single thing I learned doing them.</p>

<p>If I'm being honest with myself, there are two fundamental reasons why I'd consider paying for a design course: 1) to escape the uncertainty and feelings of frustration that comes with learning a new skill and 2) because paying for something makes me feel like I'm making progress.</p>

<p>Right now, there's a massive gap between my taste and ability to craft anything. I have plenty of ideas for digital products (who doesn't?) but whenever I try to make them, I fall short. My expectations are really high. 
I'm just not that great at using tools like Figma yet or knowing how/when to apply design principles around things like layouts, typography, information density, etc.</p>

<p>I thought learning design was going to be a fun, linear process - even though logically I know it's foolish to expect that of anything. Bootcamps also hijack that line of thinking by promising a perfectly structured, guided design education, and sometimes even guaranteeing a job after graduating!</p>

<p>Frankly, I don't even know if I want to become a full-time product designer. I just feel something in my gut telling me to design more.</p>

<p>As a teen, I was intrinsically drawn to design, and my learning was self-directed. I'd pick up tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Google Sketchup, mainly by tackling personal projects or occasionally as part of the coursework for my industrial design class.</p>

<p>Looking back now, it was never fun all the time. I'd often struggle for hours trying to get something to look right, or just work! The difference between then vs. now is I didn't run away from that struggle. I knew I was learning. As I grew older and followed a different career path, I held on to the belief that struggling in that way was a waste of time.</p>

<p>What held me back from exploring design over the years was my mindset, and falling victim to what I call the "Flywheel of Inaction":</p>

<p>I can't count how many times I've felt this yearning to explore design but gave up the minute it didn't go my way. Now, I'm 31 years old and can't help but feel like I missed an opportunity to invest in myself.</p>

<p>Sure, it's a cliche but there's truth to it.</p>

<p>Anyways, here's something I worked on last week:</p>

<p>This isn't a screenshot from my Mac. I managed to recreate the entire Arc Browser UI in Figma, by copying and following Mac Nason's Arc Browser UI Kit file.</p>

<p>I started a blank design file and recreated each of the components including sections, buttons etc. (except for some icons I found too difficult and time-consuming to remake).</p>

<p>To be honest, this exercise gave me a ton of appreciation for digital product designers. It's not easy to recreate an existing UI in the way Mac did. Now, imagine designing it from scratch!</p>

<p>Copying feels like a great way to learn Figma. All the design decisions that connect components together or display them to the end user in a certain way have already been made. It becomes my job to draw those connections and make sense of them.</p>
