<p>Trying to learn product design has been fun, but also daunting. It's such a complex and multifaceted discipline that I often feel like I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.</p>

<p>I thought about doing a UX bootcamp but I've read mixed reviews about them, and they're pretty expensive. Besides, I've fallen into the trap before of paying thousands of dollars for courses, and I usually can't remember a single thing I learned doing them.</p>

<p>If I'm being honest with myself, there are two fundamental reasons why I'd consider paying for a design course: 1) to escape the uncertainty and feelings frustration that come with learning a new skill and 2) because paying for something makes me feel like I'm making progress.</p>

<p>Right now, there's a massive gap between my taste and ability to craft anything. I have plenty of ideas for digital products (who doesn't?) but whenever I try to make them, I fall short. My expectations are really high. 
I'm just not that great at using tools like Figma yet or knowing how/when to apply design principles around things like layouts, typography, information density, etc.</p>

<p>I thought learning design was going to be a fun, linear process - even though logically I know it's foolish to expect that of anything. Bootcamps also hijack that line of thinking by promising a perfectly structured, guided design education, and sometimes even guaranteeing a job after graduating!</p>

<p>Frankly, I don't even know if I want to become a full-time product designer. I just feel something in my gut telling me to design more.</p>

<p>As a teen, I was intrinsically drawn to design, and my learning was self-directed. I'd pick up tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Google Sketchup, mainly by tackling personal projects or occasionally as part of the coursework for my industrial design class.</p>

<p>Looking back now, it was never fun all the time. I'd often struggle for hours trying to get something to look right, or just work! The difference between then vs. now is I didn't run away from that struggle. I knew I was learning. As I grew older and followed a different career path, I held on to a belief that struggling in that way was a waste of time.</p>

<p>What held me back from exploring design over the years was my mindset, and falling victim to what I call the "Flywheel of Inaction":</p>
