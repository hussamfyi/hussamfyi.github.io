title: Do you trust yourself?
---

On Saturday July 29th, a battle for the ages took place in the UFC for the BMF title: [Dustin Poirier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Poirier) vs. [Justin Gaethje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gaethje) II. If you're a true fan of the sport, you weren't going to miss it. Legacy was on the line. Not to mention, both fighters have a reputation for putting on exciting, high-caliber fights, with everything a combat sports fan could ask for; devastating power, precise technicality and a pure display of grit.

In the weeks leading up to the fight, I watched several media interviews of both fighters, because I wanted to understand their mindset, motivations and fears. One particular conversation between Dustin Poirier and UFC Commentator John Anik caught my attention. Dustin was [asked a question](https://youtu.be/PNPYvBc4CKA?t=138) about resilience, and how he had been able to consistently beat dangerous, fast-charging opponents (like Justin Gaethje) throughout his career.

Here's Dustin's wonderful response:

> I know going in there that it's a fight. And bad things are probably going to happen...**I trust myself to find a way to persevere and find an opening, and just stay in there...I don't know...I just trust myself.**

Unfortunately, Dustin didn't win the fight on Saturday. But the loss doesn't take away from the power of those words. Whenever we're taking the road less traveled, we can choose to trust ourselves to figure things out.

## Trust yourself

After quitting my full-time job as a product manager last year, my biggest struggle has been figuring out how to balance work and play in my life. More specifically, how do I carve out time to develop new skills or work on things that energize me, if there isn't an immediate payoff?

I don't know when I'll go back to full-time work or how I'm going to make money, and that's okay. Dustin's quote is a helpful reminder: You can trust yourself. Reflect on your past successes - these are real data points you can reference anytime. Let them sit in the back of your mind, and call on them when the road ahead seems foggy. Trust yourself to persevere, and find an opening to thrive.

### The journey ahead

I'm embarking on a new journey. To write more. To practice design. To sketch again. These are things I loved to do as a kid, but I foolishly gave them up, because I convinced myself I needed to in order to become a functioning adult.

For now, my only goal for the next week is to play more. That's it. To use a digital or physical canvas as my playground for creative exploration and self-expression.

Each day, I'm choosing to commit to:
- Publishing 1 essay (150 to 300 words)
- Practicing design for at least 2 hours
- Sketching for 1 hour

**I trust myself.**
