On Saturday July 29th, a battle for the ages took place on the [UFC 291](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-291) card for the BMF title: [Dustin Poirier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Poirier) vs. [Justin Gaethje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Gaethje) II.

If you're a fan of the sport, you weren't going to miss it. It was a legacy bout. Not to mention, both fighters have a reputation for putting on exciting, high-caliber fights. It promised everything a combat sports fan could ask for; devastating power, precise technicality and a pure display of grit.

In the weeks leading up to the fight, I watched several media interviews of both fighters, because I wanted to understand their mindset, motivations and fears. One particular [conversation](https://youtu.be/PNPYvBc4CKA) between Dustin Poirier and UFC Commentator John Anik caught my attention. Dustin was [asked a question](https://youtu.be/PNPYvBc4CKA?t=138) about resilience, and how he had been able to consistently beat dangerous, fast-charging opponents (like Justin Gaethje) throughout his career.

Here's how Dustin responded:

> I know going in there that it's a fight. And bad things are probably going to happen...**I trust myself to find a way to persevere and find an opening, and just stay in there...I don't know...I just trust myself.**

While Dustin didn't win the fight on Saturday, the loss doesn't take away from the power of those words. Whether in defeat, or when taking the road less traveled, we can always choose to trust ourselves to figure things out.

## Trust yourself

After quitting my full-time job as a product manager last year, my biggest struggle has been figuring out how to balance work and play in my life.

> How do I carve out time to develop new skills or work on things that energize me, if there isn't an immediate payoff?

I don't know when I'll go back to full-time work or how I'm going to make money, and that's okay. Dustin's quote is a helpful reminder: You can trust yourself. Reflect on your past successes - these are real data points you can reference anytime. Let them sit in the back of your mind, and call on them when the road ahead seems foggy. Trust yourself to persevere, and find an opening to thrive.

## Create more

The idea of trusting myself is relevant to me because, as someone that's self-employed, I'm in complete control of how I spend my time. And I've been meaning to use that time to create more. To write often. To practice design. To sketch again. These are things I loved to do as a kid but I lost touch with over the years.

Lately, I've mostly tried to avoid doing creative things I genuinely enjoy because deep down I feel like doing them would be a waste of time. I want to challenge myself to break that line of thinking, so I'm setting a challenge for myself over the coming week to play more. That's it. To use a digital or physical canvas as my playground for creative exploration and self-expression.

Each day, I'll challenge myself to play by:
- Writing thoughts
- Learning about design
- Using Figma
- Sketching
- Doing any other playful, creative thing I can think of

These things might not make me any money (at least not right away).

I don't know what doing these things will lead to in the long run.

And I recognize that on some days, I might not feel a natural pull to play at all.

But regardless of what happens...

**I trust myself.**
