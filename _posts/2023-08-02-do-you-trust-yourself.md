title: Do you trust yourself?
---

It's simple but powerful question. Do you trust yourself?

On Saturday July 29th, a battle for the ages took place in the UFC for the BMF title: Dustin Poirier vs. Justin Gaethje II. If you're a true fan of the sport, you weren't going to miss it. Legacy was on the line. Not to mention, both fighters have a reputation for putting on exciting, high-caliber fights, with everything a combat sports fan could ask for; devastating power, precise technicality and a pure display of grit.

In the week leading up to the fight I watched several media interviews of both fighters, because I wanted to understand their mindset, motivations and fears. A conversation between Dustin Poirier and UFC Commentator John Anik caught my attention. Jon [asked](https://youtu.be/PNPYvBc4CKA?t=138) a question about resilience and how it's helped Dustin consistently beat dangerous, fast-charging opponents (like Justin Gaethje) throughout his career.

Here's Dustin's response:

> I know going in there that it's a fight. And bad things are probably going to happen. I'd love to go in there, clean the guy up, get out scratch-free and meet my family after. But I expect [bad things] to happen in these fights and **I trust myself to find a way to persevere and find an opening, and just stay in there...I don't know...I just trust myself.**

That last bit about trusting one's self struck a deep chord with me.
